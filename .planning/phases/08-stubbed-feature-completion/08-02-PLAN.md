<objective>
Make every phone number and email address displayed in the app tappable: tap phone opens dialer, tap email opens email client. Apply uniformly across customer, HVC, activity, and broker detail screens.

Purpose: Enable sales reps to quickly contact customers and key persons directly from any detail screen without manual number copying.
Output: All phone/email fields and key person card buttons across 4 detail screens launch native dialer/email via url_launcher.

**Customer detail screen:**

1. **Info tab phone/email fields**: Find the `_InfoTab` widget or `_InfoRow` widgets displaying phone and email. Make them tappable by wrapping with `GestureDetector` or `InkWell`, or adding an `onTap` callback. When phone is tapped, call `launchUrl(Uri.parse('tel:${phone}'))`. When email is tapped, call `launchUrl(Uri.parse('mailto:${email}'))`. Style the tappable text with primary color and underline to indicate it's tappable. The screen already imports `url_launcher` and likely has a `_launchUrl` helper — reuse it.

2. **Key person cards phone button**: Find the `_KeyPersonCard` widget. The phone `IconButton` currently has `// TODO: Call` — wire it to `launchUrl(Uri.parse('tel:${keyPerson.phone}'))`.

3. **Key person cards email button**: Find the COMMENTED OUT email `IconButton` in `_KeyPersonCard`. Uncomment it and wire to `launchUrl(Uri.parse('mailto:${keyPerson.email}'))`. Only show if `keyPerson.email != null`.

**HVC detail screen:**

1. **Key person cards phone button**: Find the `_KeyPersonCard` widget. Wire the phone button (currently has `// TODO: Launch phone`) to `launchUrl(Uri.parse('tel:${keyPerson.phone}'))`.

2. **Key person cards email button**: Find the COMMENTED OUT email `IconButton`. Uncomment it and wire to `launchUrl(Uri.parse('mailto:${keyPerson.email}'))`. Only show if `keyPerson.email != null`.

3. **HVC main contact fields**: HVC entity itself has NO phone/email fields (contact is only on key persons), so no info tab changes needed for HVC.

4. If `url_launcher` is not already imported in hvc_detail_screen.dart, add the import.

For all `launchUrl` calls, use the existing pattern from customer_detail_screen.dart (check if there's a `_launchUrl` helper that does `canLaunchUrl` check first). If a helper exists, reuse that pattern. If not, at minimum use `launchUrl(uri)` directly — url_launcher handles failures gracefully.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `flutter analyze` on both modified files. Verify no commented-out email buttons remain. Verify all `// TODO: Call` and `// TODO: Launch phone` comments are replaced with actual launchUrl calls.</verify>
  <done>Customer detail info tab phone/email are tappable. Customer and HVC key person card phone buttons are wired. Email buttons are uncommented and wired on both screens. All use launchUrl with tel: and mailto: schemes.</done>

**Activity detail screen:**

1. Find where the PIC (key person) is displayed — the research indicates key person name is shown at line ~131. Add phone and email action buttons (IconButtons) next to or below the PIC name. If the activity's key person has a phone number, show a phone icon button that calls `launchUrl(Uri.parse('tel:${picPhone}'))`. If the key person has an email, show an email icon button that calls `launchUrl(Uri.parse('mailto:${picEmail}'))`.

2. The activity entity may not directly include key person phone/email — check the provider data. The PIC details might come from a separate key person lookup. If the activity only stores `keyPersonId` and `keyPersonName`, you may need to watch a `keyPersonProvider(keyPersonId)` to get the contact details, or check if the activity detail provider already enriches with key person data.

3. If `url_launcher` is not already imported, add `import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';`.

**Broker detail screen:**

1. **Info tab phone/email fields**: Find the `_InfoTab` or `_InfoRow` widgets displaying broker phone and email. Make them tappable using the same pattern as customer detail — `GestureDetector`/`InkWell` wrapping with `launchUrl(Uri.parse('tel:${phone}'))` and `launchUrl(Uri.parse('mailto:${email}'))`. Style with primary color and underline.

2. **Broker key person cards**: Check the `_KeyPersonCard` widget in broker_detail_screen.dart. Research says it uses `ListTile` style without dedicated buttons. Add `IconButton` widgets for phone and email to the trailing section of the ListTile, or convert to the same card pattern used in customer/HVC screens. If key person has phone, show phone IconButton. If key person has email, show email IconButton.

3. If `url_launcher` is not already imported, add `import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';`.

For all screens, use consistent styling: phone/email text should use `colorScheme.primary` color with `TextDecoration.underline` to visually indicate tappability.

  <verify>Run `flutter analyze` on both modified files. Verify activity detail has PIC contact actions. Verify broker detail has tappable phone/email in info tab and key person cards.</verify>
  <done>Activity detail PIC section has phone and email action buttons. Broker detail info tab phone/email are tappable. Broker key person cards have phone and email action buttons. All use launchUrl with tel: and mailto: schemes consistently.</done>

1. `flutter analyze` passes with no errors in all 4 modified files
2. Customer detail: info tab phone/email are tappable, key person phone wired, email uncommented and wired
3. HVC detail: key person phone wired, email uncommented and wired
4. Activity detail: PIC has phone/email contact action buttons
5. Broker detail: info tab phone/email tappable, key person cards have phone/email buttons
6. All use url_launcher's `launchUrl()` with `tel:` and `mailto:` URI schemes

<success_criteria>
- Every phone number displayed anywhere in customer, HVC, activity, and broker detail screens is tappable and opens phone dialer
- Every email address displayed anywhere in those screens is tappable and opens email client
- Contact buttons on key person cards work uniformly across all screens
</success_criteria>
